AI INTERVIEWER CI/CD DOCUMENTATION
================================

# Welcome to the CI/CD Circus ðŸŽª

Hereâ€™s where the robots do the heavy lifting so you donâ€™t have to. Our CI/CD setup is powered by GitHub Actions, which means every time you push to `main`, a well-trained bot springs into action to deploy your code. (No actual robots were harmed in the making of this pipeline.)

## Whatâ€™s Automated?
- **Backend Deployment**: Whenever you push changes to `backend/`, the `deploy-backend.yml` workflow leaps into action. It:
  - Checks out your code (because trust issues).
  - Sets up SSH (with more secrets than your group chat).
  - Syncs the backend code to a Google Compute Engine VM.
  - Installs dependencies, runs migrations, and restarts the backend server.
- **Frontend Deployment**: Push to `frontend/` and `deploy-frontend.yml` will:
  - Check out your code (again, trust issues).
  - Install Node.js and dependencies.
  - Build the frontend (so your changes look pretty).
  - Sync the build to the VM and deploy it.

## Whereâ€™s the Magic?
- All the action happens in `.github/workflows/`.
- Secrets are managed in GitHub (so donâ€™t go looking for passwords in the code â€” you wonâ€™t find any, we promise).

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If your deployment fails, donâ€™t panic. Check the Actions tab on GitHub for logs. (Or just blame the last person who pushed.)
- Make sure your secrets are set up in the repo settings. If you see a mysterious error, itâ€™s probably a missing secret.
- If all else fails, try turning it off and on again. (Classic.)

## Want to Deploy Manually?
- You can always SSH into the VM and do things the old-fashioned way. But whereâ€™s the fun in that?

## Final Words
- Our CI/CD is here to make your life easier. Treat it well, and itâ€™ll treat you well. (Mostly.)

Happy deploying!
